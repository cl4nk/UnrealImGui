/**
 * Defines behaviour when handling input events. It allows to customize handling of the keyboard and gamepad input,
 * primarily to support shortcuts in ImGui input mode. Since mouse is not really needed for this functionality and
 * mouse pointer state and focus are closely connected to input mode, mouse events are left out of this interface.
 *
 * When receiving keyboard and gamepad events ImGui Widget calls input handler to query expected behaviour. By default,
 * with a few exceptions (see @ OnKeyDown) all events are expected to be processed and consumed. Custom implementations
 * may tweak that behaviour and/or inject custom code.
 *
 * Note that returned response is only treated as a hint. In current implementation all consume requests are respected
 * but to protect from locking ImGui input states, key up events are always processed. Decision about blocking certain
 * inputs can be taken during key down events and processing corresponding key up events should not make difference.
 *
 * Also note that input handler functions are only called when ImGui Widget is receiving input events, what can be for
 * instance suppressed by opening console.
 *
 * See @ Project Settings/Plugins/ImGui/Input/ImGuiInputHandlerClass property to set custom implementation.
